# Application Architecture

This document outlines the architecture of the CI/CD pipeline and the mobile application.

## 1. CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

The CI/CD pipeline will be built using GitHub Actions and a set of platform-agnostic shell scripts.

*   **Source Code Management:** The source code will be hosted on GitHub.
*   **CI/CD Platform:** GitHub Actions will be used to orchestrate the build, test, and deployment processes.
*   **Build Scripts:** The core build logic will be contained in shell scripts located in the `.ci/` directory. These scripts will be responsible for setting up the environment, building the application, and running tests.
*   **Directory Structure:** The `.ci/` directory will be organized by platform (iOS, Android) and then by step (e.g., `setup_environment.sh`, `build_app.sh`).
*   **Workflows:** GitHub Actions workflows will be defined in YAML files in the `.github/workflows/` directory. These workflows will call the build scripts in the correct order.

## 2. Mobile Application Architecture

The mobile application will consist of a simple React application wrapped in either Tauri or RhoMobile.

*   **React Application:** A basic "Hello World" React application will serve as the user interface.
*   **Tauri:** The Tauri framework will be used to package the React application into a native mobile application for both iOS and Android.
*   **RhoMobile:** The RhoMobile framework will also be used to package the React application into a native mobile application for both iOS and Android.
