# Coding Rules

This document outlines the coding rules and best practices that all AI agents must follow when working on this project. The goal is to ensure that the codebase is consistent, readable, and maintainable.

## 1. General Principles

*   **Clarity and Simplicity:** Write code that is easy to understand and maintain. Avoid overly complex solutions when a simpler one will suffice.
*   **Consistency:** Follow the coding style and patterns used in the existing codebase.
*   **Comments:** Add meaningful comments to the code to explain complex logic, assumptions, or intentions. Do not comment on obvious code.

## 2. Naming Conventions

*   **Variables and Functions:** Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables and functions. Use camelCase for variable and function names (e.g., `myVariable`, `myFunction`).
*   **Classes and Components:** Use PascalCase for class and component names (e.g., `MyClass`, `MyComponent`).
*   **Constants:** Use uppercase with underscores for constants (e.g., `MY_CONSTANT`).

## 3. Code Formatting

*   **Indentation:** Use 2 spaces for indentation.
*   **Line Length:** Keep lines of code to a reasonable length (e.g., 80-120 characters).
*   **Whitespace:** Use whitespace to improve readability.

## 4. Best Practices for the Selected Stack

The specific technology stack for this project is yet to be determined. However, the following general best practices should be followed:

*   **Modularity:** Break down the code into smaller, reusable modules or components.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle unexpected situations.
*   **Testing:** Write unit and integration tests to ensure the quality and correctness of the code.
*   **Dependencies:** Keep dependencies up to date and remove any unused dependencies.

## 5. Code Reviews

All code must be reviewed before it is merged into the main branch. The code review process should focus on ensuring that the code adheres to the coding rules and best practices outlined in this document.
