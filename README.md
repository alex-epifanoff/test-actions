# CI/CD Pipeline for React Native Application

This project aims to set up a robust CI/CD pipeline for a React application intended to run on both Android and iOS platforms. The application will be wrapped in a native app container using a suitable framework. This document outlines the project's goals, structure, and development process.

## Project Overview

The core objective is to automate the build, test, and deployment processes for the React Native application. This will ensure a streamlined and efficient development lifecycle, from code commit to app store release.

### Key Features

*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** The application will be developed to run seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.
*   **Automated CI/CD:** The pipeline will handle automated builds, unit and integration testing, and deployment to testing and production environments.
*   **Framework Selection:** A key part of the initial phase will be to select the most appropriate framework for wrapping the React application into native containers.

## Development Process

The development process will be driven by AI agents, following a structured protocol to ensure consistency, quality, and efficiency. The process will be guided by a master plan and a detailed implementation plan, which will be updated as the project progresses.
